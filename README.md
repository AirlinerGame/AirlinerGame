# Airliner Game

### *The OpenSource Airline and Airport Management Game*

AirlineGame is an economy management game currently in development. Goal of the project is to create a free and somehow realistic airport/airline management game for Windows and Linux.

The game is written in C# and is using the popular Framework MonoGame. The development is going to take some time though since I'm developing a lot of Librarys for management games like this one. Let's help people to easily create games like Airline Tycoon, Theme Hospital, Casino Tycoon...

If you can't wait to play a game like this... Have a look at [The Airline Project](http://theairlineproject.com) (OpenSource) [Windows only / WPF UI] or the old Airline Tycoon (Closed Source)

## ToDo

Since I want to support the OpenSource community as much as they support me I'm going to develop and release Libs and Tools for .NET Game Development.

This contains Librarys for:

* Managing Game Content (File Archives with Patching Support)
* Transaction / Money API (Easy Money Management for Games)
* Graphs for MonoGame with Neoforce UI Support
* Networking (Easy extendable Multi-Client TCP/IP Packet/Object Mapping)

## License

I didn't decide yet which OpenSource License I want to use for this game. That means that you can't contribute to the project yet. (I don't want nasty legal problems at some point, because some developer decided we are not allowed to use his code anymore.)

That said I'm going to decide soon and will provide a CLA which enables everyone to contribute to this game.

## Credits

* [MonoGame](https://github.com/mono/MonoGame) - Thanks! You guys are awesome :-)
* [NeoForce GUI](https://github.com/NeoforceControls/Neoforce-Mono) - Airliner is using a lot of his components and/or is using this components as base classes for own components. Thanks! :)
* [FMOD](http://www.fmod.com) - Awesome Audio Lib with a OpenSource friendly License. Thanks :)

A lot of Images are not licensed or OpenSource! I used them for Prototyping. So don't distribute the code/game at the moment.
