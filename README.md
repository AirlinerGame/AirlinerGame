# Airliner Game

### *The OpenSource Airline and Airport Management Game*

AirlineGame is an economy management game currently in development. Goal of the project is to create a free and somehow realistic game for Windows and Linux.

The game is written in C# and is using the popular Framework MonoGame.

## License

I didn't decide yet which OpenSource License I want to use for this game. That means that you can't contribute to the project yet. (I don't want nasty legal problems at some point, because some developer decided we are not allowed to use his code anymore.)

That said I'm going to decide soon and will provide a CLA which enables everyone to contribute to this game.

## Credits

 - MonoGame - Thanks! You guys are awesome :-)
 - NeoForce GUI - Airliner is using a lot of his components and/or is using this components as base classes for own components. Thanks! :)

A lot of Images are not licensed or OpenSource! I used them for Prototyping. So don't distribute the code/game at the moment.
